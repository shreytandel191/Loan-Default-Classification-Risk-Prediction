# Loan Default Classification & Risk Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default using historical data from Lending Clubâ€”one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms in the U.S. The goal is to build a machine learning model that helps financial institutions assess credit risk before issuing a loan, thereby reducing losses and improving portfolio quality.
