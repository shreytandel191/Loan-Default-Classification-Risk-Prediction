# Loan Default Classification & Risk Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default using historical data from Lending Clubâ€”one of the largest peer-to-peer lending platforms in the U.S. The goal is to build a machine learning model that helps financial institutions assess credit risk before issuing a loan, thereby reducing losses and improving portfolio quality.

## Business Objective
Lending institutions face significant losses when borrowers default. Identifying high-risk borrowers at the time of loan application enables smarter lending decisions.
This project helps answer key business questions:\n

Who is likely to default on a loan?
What borrower or loan characteristics are associated with higher risk?
How can machine learning be used to improve credit assessment?
